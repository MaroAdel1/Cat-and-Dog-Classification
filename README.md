# Cat-and-Dog-Classification
 Built a CNN model to classify grayscale images of cats and dogs (80x80 pixels). Used OpenCV for image preprocessing and trained two architectures (4-layer and 6-layer) with learning rate scheduling. Evaluated performance using accuracy and loss graphs with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
